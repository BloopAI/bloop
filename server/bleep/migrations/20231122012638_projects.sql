-- This is a partial migration to migrate to the new `projects` structure. Here, we try to migrate
-- as much of the data as possible. However, we cannot migrate everything as some JSON data has to
-- be directly manipulated, in a way that is difficult with plain SQLite. As a compromise, we create
-- a `rust_migrations` table, and keep track of logical changes there, intended to be applied
-- immediately after all other pending database migrations.

-- First, we have to modify studios & snapshots. This involves recreating the `studios` table, and
-- consequently also the `studio_snapshots` table, as SQLite doesn't allow us to dynamically modify
-- foreign key constraints. So, we instead recreate both tables and copy data as required.

-- migrate JSON data has been applied.
