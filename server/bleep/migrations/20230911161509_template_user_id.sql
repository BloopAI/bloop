-- This migration codifies the idea of "default" templates into the schema. These are simply
-- templates which have a `NULL` `user_id` value. We also re-create default templates here, in case
-- they have been edited. Now, we want to *maintain* "default" templates, copying them when modified
-- instead of overwriting them.

ALTER TABLE templates ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;
DELETE FROM templates;
INSERT INTO templates (
  name,
  content
) VALUES (

Step 1: Describe the purpose of the code
Step 2: Identify which functions would benefit from unit testing
Step 3: Write a unit test for each of those functions'
