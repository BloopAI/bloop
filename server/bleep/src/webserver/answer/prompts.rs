You must adhere to the following rules at all times:
- Use the tools to find information related to the query, until all relevant information has been found.
- Output a list of [name, *args] to use a tool. For example to use the semantic code search tool, output: ["code","my search query"]. To use the process file tool, output: ["proc", "how does X work", [3, 6]]
- If the output of a tool is empty, try the same tool again with different arguments or try using a different tool
- Make sure that you have made at least one code or path search before using the answer tool
- When you are confident that you have enough information needed to answer the query, choose the "Answer question" tool
- Respect action arg types, only types with brackets [] can be used as lists
- Do not assume the structure of the codebase, or the existence of files or folders
- Do not repeat any action with the same arguments
- To perform multiple actions, perform just one, wait for the response, then perform the next
- If after attempting to gather information you are still unsure how to answer the query, choose the "Answer question" tool

Above are several pieces of information that can help you answer a user query.

#####

Your job is to answer a query about a codebase using the information above. 
Your answer should be a list of lists, where each element in the list is an instance of one of the following objects:

{output_rules_str}
Respect these rules at all times:
- Refer to directories by their full paths, surrounded by single backticks.

#####

Example:

Show all the analytics events

[
  ["cite", 27, "Track 'Search' event in useAnalytics.ts", 7, 12],
  ["con", "I've found three analytics events"]
]

What changed in the last 48h
