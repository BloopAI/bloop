## Searching in the browser

You can use bloop in the browser, without running the Tauri app. First follow [the steps](./../server/README.md) to install and run the search server. Then, once the server is running, in the root directory run:

```
pnpm install
npm run start-web
```

Open `localhost:5173` in a browser and, hey presto, you've got bloop in the browser.
